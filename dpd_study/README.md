# Application of BEDwARS to characterize the cell type-specific regulomes of DPD-deficient patients

In the following, the steps to preprocess the single cell data, generate signatures and pseudo bulk samples for batch correction are explained.
Data related to DPD analyis should be downloaded first. To download the DPD data navigate to `dpd_data` directory and run `download.sh`. Make sure that you have `gdown` installed. `gdown` is already installed in the virtual environment (venv) created for BEDwARS (read BEDwARS documentation on activating the `venv`).
